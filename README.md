# Amazon-Ebay-Webscraper
This repository is dedicated to a project I worked on as part of a Medium article.

For this project, I create a webscraper application that scrapes product information from Amazon and Ebay. Using TkInter in Python, I create a user-friendly GUI from this that is able to efficiently display the top 10 items from each website's query
